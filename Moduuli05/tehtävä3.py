"""Write a program that asks the user for an integer and tells if the number is a prime number. Prime numbers are number that are only divisible by one or the number itself.

For example, 13 is a prime number as it can only be divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.
On the other hand, 21 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 7."""
